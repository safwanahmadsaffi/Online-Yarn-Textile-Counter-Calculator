## Table of Indirect Systems
**Key Formula**:  
`Count = Length (unit) / Weight (unit)`

| System Name               | Weight Unit | Length Unit               |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| English Cotton            | 1 lb        | Hank of 840 yards         |
| French Cotton             | 1 kg        | Hank of 1000 meters       |
| Bump Cotton               | 1 oz        | 1 yard                    |
| Decimal                   | 1 lb        | Hank of 1000 yards        |
| Metric                    | 1 kg        | Hank of 1000 meters       |
| Worsted                   | 1 lb        | Hank of 560 yards         |
| Linen (Wet Spun)          | 1 lb        | Lea of 300 yards          |
| Woolen-Yorkshire Skein    | 6 lbs       | Skein of 1536 yards       |
| Woolen-American Cut       | 1 lb        | Cut of 300 yards          |
| Asbestos-British          | 1 lb        | Hank of 50 yards          |

## Table of Direct Systems
**Key Formula**:  
`Count = Weight (unit) / Length (unit)`

| System Name   | Weight Unit | Length Unit          |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Tex           | Grams (g)   | 1000 meters          |
| Decitex       | Grams (g)   | 10000 meters         |
| Denier        | Grams (g)   | 9000 meters          |
| Spindle       | Pounds (lb) | 14400 yards          |

## Calculation Examples

### Indirect System Example (English Cotton)
**Problem**:  
240 yards of yarn weighs 40 grains. Find the count.

**Solution**:
1. Convert grains to pounds:  
   `40 grains = 40/7000 lbs ≈ 0.005714 lbs`
2. Calculate hanks:  
   `240 yards = 240/840 hanks = 0.2857 hanks`
3. Apply formula:  

---
    Count = (Length in hanks) / (Weight in lbs)
= 0.2857 / 0.005714
= 50’s Cotton


### Direct System Example (Tex)
**Problem**:  
1000 meters of yarn weighs 5 grams. Find the count.

**Solution**:  
Count = Weight (g) / Length (km)
= 5 g / 1 km
= 5 Tex

## Key Formulas

### Indirect System
1. **Basic Formula**:  
   `Count = Length / Weight`
2. **Weight Calculation**:  
   `Weight = Length / Count`
3. **Length Calculation**:  
   `Length = Count × Weight`

### Direct System
1. **Basic Formula**:  
   `Count = Weight / Length`
2. **Weight Calculation**:  
   `Weight = Count × Length`
3. **Length Calculation**:  
   `Length = Weight / Count`

## Unit Conversion Factors
| Conversion                | Factor                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 lb (pound)              | = 7000 grains              |
| 1 lb                      | = 453.592 grams            |
| 1 yard                    | = 0.9144 meters            |
| 1 oz (ounce)              | = 28.3495 grams            |

## Quick Reference Guide Textile Industry
- **Use Indirect Systems for**: Natural fibers (cotton, linen, wool)
- **Use Direct Systems for**: Artificial fibers (polyester, nylon)
- Higher indirect count = Finer yarn  
  Higher direct count = Coarser yarn
